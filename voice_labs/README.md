Voice satellites with commands you make yourself, recognized on your own Home
Assistant. A command says what to listen for, where, and what happens: speak a
response, run a script, activate a scene, or run an action. It hears and
speaks English.

![The Home page: the whole home's commands, grouped by what they're for](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHF-Voice/apps-experimental/main/voice_labs/images/home.png)

## Highlights

- **Commands you make yourself.** Start from the library -- lights, timers
  and alarms, music, weather, climate, covers and locks, lists, reminders,
  announcements and intercom -- or from scratch. A library command keeps
  following the library as it gets better, with your changes on top.
- **Heard on your own machine.** Commands are recognized in the audio
  itself, against the names of your areas and devices -- and the ones you
  give them on the Names page.

![An area's names: what its devices are called there, and in the whole house](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHF-Voice/apps-experimental/main/voice_labs/images/names.png)

- **Most of the work happens while you're still talking.** The wake word is
  checked again and the speaker recognized as you speak; when you stop, it
  acts and answers.

![A command's timeline: the wake word is checked, the speaker recognized and the words transcribed while you speak](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHF-Voice/apps-experimental/main/voice_labs/images/call.png)

- **Wake words, checked twice.** The satellite listens generously, and
  every wake word it hears is checked again against phrases that sound like
  it ("hey travis", "hey microsoft"). Okay Nabu, Hey Jarvis and Hey Mycroft
  are built in; upload your own, or train one in the app. Up to five per
  satellite.
- **Something sensible when nothing matches.** Skills answer exactly
  ("what's twelve times eight"), the commands you choose are found by what
  you meant ("kill the lights in the office", "give me ten minutes for the
  pasta"), questions go to your conversation agent, and otherwise it says the
  closest command and what was missing.

- **It knows who's speaking.** Enroll voices on the People page, and "add
  call mom to my to-do list", "remind me" and "play my playlist" are the
  speaker's own.
- **By area.** A command is the whole home's or one area's, and the whole
  home's can be turned off where they don't belong ("That command isn't
  available in the Kitchen"). Do not disturb and night mode, area by area.
- **Conversations, not just commands.** A command can ask before it acts,
  and "it" is what you just named.
- **Timers and alarms** ring on the satellite that set them, and its LED
  ring shows each timer, who's speaking, and how it went.

![The satellite's ring: three timers, someone speaking, another satellite answering, and night mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHF-Voice/apps-experimental/main/voice_labs/images/ring.png)

- **Every session, step by step.** What was heard, what ran and what was
  said, with how long each step took. Replay a session, or type a sentence to
  see what it would do.

- **Other satellites too.** Home Assistant's own voice assistants can use
  the app's speech-to-text, text-to-speech and conversation agent, through
  [Wyoming](#other-satellites-through-wyoming).

## Install

You need Home Assistant 2025.10 or later, on amd64 or aarch64, and a
[Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/)
to flash -- or, through [Wyoming](#other-satellites-through-wyoming), any
satellite Home Assistant has.

1. **The app.**
   [![Add the repository to your Home Assistant.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FOHF-Voice%2Fapps-experimental)
   Add `https://github.com/OHF-Voice/apps-experimental` to Home Assistant's app
   repositories, then install **Voice Labs** and start it. The first time it
   starts, it downloads its speech models -- about 530 MB: Parakeet (speech),
   EmbeddingGemma 2 (meaning), GLiNER (the command fallback) and Piper's
   Kristin (its voice) -- into its own storage, and its page shows how far it
   got. Later starts and updates keep them.
2. **The integration.**
   [![Open this repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=OHF-Voice&repository=voice-labs&category=integration)
   In [HACS](https://hacs.xyz), add `https://github.com/OHF-Voice/voice-labs`
   as a custom repository of type **Integration**, download **Voice Labs**,
   and restart Home Assistant. The app sets it up the next time it connects.
   It gives each satellite a device and its timers, and runs Assist's intents
   for the app.
3. **The satellites.** Flash a Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition with the
   Voice Labs firmware from its
   [install page](https://ohf-voice.github.io/voice-pe-alt-firmware/voice-pe-voice-labs/)
   and give it your Wi-Fi. The app finds it on the network and connects to it.

Then open **Voice Labs** in Home Assistant's sidebar to make commands, name
things, set up satellites and look at sessions. The
[guide](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/voice-labs) has everything it does, page
by page.

### Standalone

Without Home Assistant's app store, it runs as a container:
`ghcr.io/ohf-voice/voice-labs` (amd64 and aarch64), given Home Assistant's
address and a long-lived access token. It has no wake word training.

```bash
docker run -d --name voice-labs --network host \
  -e HASS_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 -e HASS_TOKEN=... \
  -v voice-labs:/data ghcr.io/ohf-voice/voice-labs
```

The web UI (8099) and Wyoming (10800) listen on every address the container
has, and neither asks who's there: anyone who can reach the web UI can run
actions in Home Assistant. Without the host network, publish what you want
reached, and where (`-p 127.0.0.1:8099:8099 -p 10800:10800`). Wyoming needs
nothing more -- add it to Home Assistant as a Wyoming Protocol integration --
but finding the satellites does: they're found by mDNS, which a container's
own network doesn't carry (`--host` reaches one without it). More options go
after the image name.

### From source

See [Running from source](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/apps-experimental/blob/main/voice_labs/DESIGN.md#running-from-source) in the design notes.

## Other satellites, through Wyoming

Without the Voice Labs firmware, a satellite can still use the app: it is
also a Wyoming service, for Home Assistant's own voice assistants. That's a
Voice PE with Home Assistant's firmware, another ESPHome satellite,
[Linux Voice Assistant](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/linux-voice-assistant),
your phone, or what's typed in Assist.

1. **Install the app and the integration** (steps 1 and 2 above).
2. **Add the Wyoming service.** Home Assistant finds it: **Settings >
   Devices & services**, Discovered. Standalone, add the **Wyoming Protocol**
   integration with the app's address and port 10800.
3. **Make a voice assistant** in **Settings > Voice assistants**, with Voice
   Labs as its speech-to-text, text-to-speech and conversation agent -- all
   three, or any of them -- and choose it for the satellite.
4. **Name things** on the Names page, and put the satellite's device in an
   area in Home Assistant: its commands are that area's.

The same as on a Voice Labs satellite:

- Your commands, skills, "When nothing matches" and conversation agent, in
  the satellite's area. A question asked back keeps the conversation going,
  and the satellite listens for the answer.
- Speech-to-text writes what it heard as the command it heard, with your
  names spelled as on the Names page: "Turn on the Nanoleaf.", where the
  speech model alone hears "Turn on the Neno leave". With Voice Labs as the
  conversation agent too, the command is recognized in the audio.
- Text-to-speech is Piper, with every voice it has: each is downloaded the
  first time it is used.
- Every session is on the Sessions page.

Only with the Voice Labs firmware:

- **The wake word, checked again.** Elsewhere it is the satellite's own.
- **Who's speaking.** Elsewhere "my" means the only person on the People
  page, when there's one.
- **Beeps.** Elsewhere a command that would beep says its brief response.
- **Timers, alarms, reminders, announcements and intercom.** Elsewhere a
  timer is Home Assistant's own, and rings on that satellite; the rest play
  only on Voice Labs satellites.
- **Night mode, the ring and the app's sounds.**
