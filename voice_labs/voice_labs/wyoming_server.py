"""Wyoming endpoints: the app's speech, voices and commands for Home
Assistant's own voice pipelines (Assist) -- satellites that aren't the
app's, and what's typed.

Two servers, each a Wyoming Protocol integration in Home Assistant:

* **The app's** (``port``, 10800 as an app), which the Supervisor announces
  to Home Assistant:

  - **Text-to-speech**: Piper, every voice of its catalog (piper_voices),
    each downloaded the first time it is asked for, and removed once it has
    gone unused for 30 days (piper_voices.Uses). Text that comes in pieces
    (an LLM's answer) is said a sentence at a time, as each is whole.
  - **A conversation agent** (``handle``): the app's commands, skills,
    fallback and conversation agent, as on a satellite of the app's in the
    asking satellite's area (VoiceLabsApp.handle_text). An LLM's answer is
    streamed as it comes. A question asked back -- a command's confirm, the
    agent's -- keeps the conversation going (``continue_conversation``).
  - **Speech-to-text** that writes what it heard as the command it heard,
    with the home's names spelled right (voice_labs/corrected.py).

* **Parakeet's** (the next port): speech-to-text alone, what the TDT head
  heard -- for a pipeline whose agent is another.

What speech-to-text gave is kept a little while with its audio
(``HeardCache``): when the same words come to the conversation agent, from
the same satellite, it is the audio that is recognized -- as the app hears
it, a doubtful match heard again, free text spelled by the TDT head -- not
the words.

As an app, only Home Assistant may connect: this machine, and the
Supervisor's network (``allow``). Standalone, the address it listens on
decides.
