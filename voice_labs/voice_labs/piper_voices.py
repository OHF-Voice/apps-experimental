"""Piper's voices, from rhasspy/piper-voices at one revision: those the
catalog lists (piper_voices.json, which scripts/piper_voices.py writes from
the repository's voices.json), each downloaded into models/piper -- the app's
data, through the image's link -- the first time it is used: the voice
replies are said in (the Settings page's, else the language's), and the one
wake words are trained with. Every file is checked against its MD5.

How a voice speaks is Piper's to tune (``SynthesisConfig``): its speaker,
when it has several, ``length_scale`` (above 1 slower), ``noise_scale`` (how
much the voice varies), ``noise_w_scale`` (how much the phonemes' lengths
vary) and ``volume``. The voice's own defaults are in its .onnx.json.
