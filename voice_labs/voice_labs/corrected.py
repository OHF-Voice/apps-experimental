"""The corrected transcript: what a command's audio was heard as, written so
that it reads back as the same command -- the speech-to-text the app gives
Home Assistant's pipelines (voice_labs/wyoming_server.py).

Its words are the speech-to-text the app uses: the TDT head's, which spells
well but doesn't know the home's names ("switch on an edge thread" for the
Nachtlicht), or an STT entity's. The CTC matcher found the command in the
audio with its names and numbers, each where it was said; so each is written
over the TDT words said there -- a name as the Names page has it, a number in
digits: "Switch on the Nachtlicht." That stands when it reads back, as the
app reads typed text (Engine.recognize_text), as the same command with the
same slots. Else the words as they are, if they do; else the command's own
words, names and numbers in the order they were heard ("switch on the
Nachtlicht"). An STT entity's words have no times to write over: they are
tried first, as they are, and then the TDT head's with the names written
over them. When none reads back -- or no command was heard -- it is the
words as heard.
