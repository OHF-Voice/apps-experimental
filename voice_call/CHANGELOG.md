# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Timers, on the satellite that set them: start, cancel, pause, resume, add or
  take off time, how long is left. A finished timer rings until "stop".
- The Voice Call integration for Home Assistant (HACS): each satellite gets a
  device with its own area and a `voice_timer_list` entity for its timers.
- A command's response can differ by how it went: `done`, `failed` (Home
  Assistant refused), a timer's `no_timers`, `not_found`, `ambiguous`,
  `already` or `missing_duration`, or an `outcome` a script returns. A plain
  response is only for `done`; the `voice_call_command` event carries the
  outcome.
- Pausing a paused timer (or resuming a running one) says it already is,
  instead of that there's no such timer.
- Music, on Music Assistant: "play …" searches and plays the closest match,
  plus pause, resume, stop, next, previous, volume, mute, shuffle, repeat,
  "play more like this", "add … to the queue" and "what's playing". A
  satellite's player is its Sendspin client's, found by MAC. The volume
  commands moved from Basics to the new Music group.
- Commands have icons, and the library marks the ones you already have.
- Library: covers and locks (by name, or by type and area or floor), "are any
  lights on", "is the garage door open", "is the front door locked", "is
  everything locked". Adding a command adds the shared value lists it uses.
- The VPE's light ring flashes while a timer rings and otherwise shows the time
  left on the timer that finishes soonest. The timer alarm is the stock VPE's
  sound, and "stop" -- or the center button -- now stops it at once.
- Home Assistant STT and TTS entities, for every satellite or per satellite.
  STT writes what TDT would (examples, free text, hints) and only when needed;
  TTS speaks on the satellite's own media player or on another one.

## 0.1.0

- Commands are the app's own: made in the web UI (or YAML), recognized with
  adapt-ctc on Parakeet's CTC output, and run in Home Assistant as scripts,
  scenes, actions or spoken responses. Sentence triggers are no longer read.
- Satellites can be given an area; commands can be scoped to areas or
  satellites and overridden there.
- Calls are traced stage by stage, and with debugging on, kept with their audio.
